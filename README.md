# sensor-fault-detection

## Problem Statement

The Air pressure system that they were build there will be some engine failures they just wanted to identify whether the failure belongs to APS or not.

In heavy vechiles we have Air Pressure System(APS) in foreign countries.If APS sensors do not work it will not able to perform the tasks because of this there may be vechile failure, brakes failure etc... when APS has some sensors if we are able to determine the fault before hand.
It is a binary class classification problem.

Here we have to predict the failure happens because of APS or not.
